      Salsa is a Latin dance, associated with the music genre of the same name,
      which was first popularized in the United States in the 1960s in New York
      City. Salsa is an amalgamation of Cuban dances, such as mambo, pachanga
      and rumba, as well as American dances such as swing and tap.
